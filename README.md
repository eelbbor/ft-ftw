Feature Toggles For The Win
==========

This is the base code for a Feature Toggle service.  The goal is to enable a RESTful service for creating and using Feature Toggles during development.  If your working in a SOA it can be a bit of a pain to implement Feature Toggles independently in every service when adding a cross-cutting feature.  A singular source for toggles can be tremendously useful, which is the goal of this work.
